 # Form Pandya Decision
 form_pandya_nation_title:0 "Restore the Pandya Kingdom"
 form_pandya_nation_desc:0 "The Pandya dynasty was one of the three ancient Tamil kingdoms that ruled southern India for over two millennia. From our capital at Madurai, the Pandyas controlled the pearl fisheries of the south and engaged in lucrative trade with Rome, Southeast Asia, and beyond. The Sangam literature celebrates our kings as patrons of Tamil culture and language. Now, with control over the entire Tamil homeland and surrounding regions, we can restore the glory of the ancient Pandya realm and reclaim our rightful place as one of the great kingdoms of India."
